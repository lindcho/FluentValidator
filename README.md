# FluentValidator

Fluent Validation is a free to use .NET validation library that helps you make your validations clean, easy to create, and maintain.
It even works on external models that you don’t have access to, with ease. With this library, you can separate the model classes from the validation logic like it is supposed to be. It doesn’t make your Model classes ugly like Data Annotations does. Also, better control of validation is something that makes the developers prefer Fluent Validation.

## Questions to discuss afterwards

* How did it feel to work with such fast, comprehensive model validation?
* Did you make mistakes while refactoring?
* If you used a tool to record your test runs, review it. Could you have taken smaller steps? Made fewer refactoring mistakes?
* Did you ever make any refactoring mistakes and then back out your changes? How did it feel to throw away code?
* What would you say to your colleague if they had written this code?
* What would you say to your boss about the value of this refactoring work? Was there more reason to do it over and above the extra billable hour or so?
